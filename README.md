# Anime Search (React) 😁

This is an anime search and viewing service where users can search for anime and view the results in a list. The app also presents top charts and popular anime series. When a user clicks on an anime, detailed information is displayed, and if a trailer is available, it can be viewed in a modal. All data is pulled from the Jikan API, which allows users to explore and get detailed information about various anime series.
